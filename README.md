# IdleTavern

Originally a school project that I had a bit too much fun with.
The project in question was the APCSP create. I knew quite a lot of programming at this point (I had already taken APCSA), so I wanted to create a project that I could be proud of. IdleTavern is what came from this. 
I occasionally enjoy getting invested in idle games like Tiny Tower and Idle Apocalypse and DnD is a game which I very much enjoy, so I decided to create an idle game using ideas from the DnD world.
